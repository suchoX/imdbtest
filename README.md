# Run The app

I have used project packaged Yarn to build this. NPM may work, but I havent tested.

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn add

# Install ios Pod dependencies (Have Cocoapods instalelled)
cd ios
pod install

# Run metro
cd ..
yarn start

# after Metro starts
# Press a for android
# Press i for ios
# If you have multiple ios devices, build using XCode
```
